You win by taking 2 enemy capitals.<br><br>

The economic values and military forces are from the Correlates of War database (http://axisandallies.wikia.com/wiki/Correlates_of_War). All land areas were given a base value of 1.<br><br>

I used the map from Napoleonic Empires. The unit capabilities are from The Great War scenario. All units have a maintenance cost of 1 per turn. Combat is limited to 1 round.<br><br>

Britain's income has been reduced by 33% to reflect its colonial commitments, failure to mobilize for total war and the difficulty of operating across the water (especially amphibious landings).<br><br>

The scenario is designed for proper AI play. Human players should not buy more than 1 of non-infantry unit per turn. Human players should not conduct amphibious landings in occupied enemy territories.<br><br>
